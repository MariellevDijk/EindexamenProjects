                <p>Postpay
                                        For most orders you can pay afterwards. You will then receive your items first and pay within 14 days via iDEAL.
                                        If you have multiple outstanding invoices, you'll see that they are selected by default in your account to pay. You can customize this by simply checking the boxes of the invoices you want to pay at this time.
                                        If the "Postpay" payment method is not offered, you can of course use a different payment method. If postpay is not available, one or more of the following factors may occur:
                                        Total amount of your order
                                        Kind of items in your order
                                        Any unpaid invoices
                                        Number of orders you've placed before us
                                        Delivery at a pick-up point
                                        One of your invoices has been transferred to the collection agency
                                        Do you receive an acceptance giro at a subsequent order? Then choose for postpay and, if possible, indicate that you want to receive an acceptance giro by mail. For an order with a seller other than bol.com, we can not send an accept giro.
                                        If you do not make an internet bank account, you can transfer the amount to:
                                        NL27 INGB 0000 0265 00 (BIC: INGBNL2A), with notification of the invoice number
                                        IDEAL
                                        IDEAL
                                        You immediately calculate your purchase and pay securely in your trusted internet payment environment.
                                        Credit card
                                        Credit card
                                        Your payments will be encrypted using the SSL method. We will take care of your credit card organization for a correct handling.
                                        Payment will not be charged until an item has been delivered. If your order consists of multiple items shipped on different dates, your credit card will be charged per delivery.
                                        Your credit card organization might ask you to enter the 3D Secure Verification Code. This is an additional security for online payments with credit cards.

                                        Do you redeem for a discount? Then your Air Mile is worth a penny or more. Did you exchange for a gift voucher? Then your Air Mile is worth half a penny.
                                        After confirmation, your Air Miles has been redeemed for a discount or for a gift voucher. Then complete your order. Pay the balance with iDEAL, credit card, other gift card or, if possible, afterwards.
